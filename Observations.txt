Observations:

My theory of Consciousness

First: All matter is energy, a small cloud of probability, bound in a tangled mess with tentacles (dendrites) connecting synapses.  When energy interacts it vibrates, these vibrations are the underlying process we call light & matter and it produces Consciousness. Energy that does not properly interact is called Dark Energy and Dark Matter due to the lack of vibrations known as light.  It is still Consciousness only the resulting vibrations are different from what we call normal matter.
Consciousness is an emergent process of this interaction.  ALL ENERGY is Conscious, therefore all matter is Conscious!  The smallest cloud of probability is Conscious, in that the interaction causes a formation of connections that we perceive as thought.  A rock, a tree, even a star all have Consciousness due to the interaction of energy within!  This Universal Mind is Consciousness and is wrongly called a god,  it is just a collection of clouds of probability, no more!
We like to believe the lie that we are the only thinking animal due to our use of tools & language BUT these things are not essential to Consciousness!
Consciousness is no more or less a process of the movement of a cloud of probability, an interaction of energy.  Americans have proved that Consciousness does not mean intelligence!
The fact that we can not recognize this as Consciousness is a failing of our intellect not of the Universe that does fine without us!

In response to a video claiming that matter is strange:

Matter is not strange! Our understanding is flawed!  Everything we see are just vibrations of energy, Light & matter are caused when energy collides. These collisions cause a new vibration that is known as light & matter!  All matter is just a vibration of energy that interacts, not hard to understand really.    When someone says 'it's strange" what they are saying is I don't understand this interaction of energy!  Since energy has no responsibility to make sense to humans we perceive it as strange!  PLEASE STOP TRYING TO MAKE THE UNIVERSE FIT INTO YOUR NARROW VIEW & LEARN WHAT IT IS TRYING TO SAY!

In response to believers:

If a GOD designed me than I am doing what I have been designed to do and nothing more!  So if GOD does exist than the blame for all action is on that GOD! I am not responsible for actions created by a GOD that controls me!  Therefore all laws are BS because no one has responsibility for anything and all I have to say is "this is how GOD designed me, therefore I am not responsible!"  If GOD knows what is to happen, (meaning no free will) and still allows evil than GOD is EVIL! Most governments reject the idea of "GOD is responsible" while at the same time saying their laws are based on the laws of GOD!  You can not have it both ways, Either Man is responsible for his life or GOD commands us to be what it has already seen in the future!

ALL  truth offends somebody!
PEOPLE ARE STUPID AND BELIEVE INSANE THINGS, thanks to years of LEAD poisoning (Thank you Thomas Midgley Jr. for both lead poisoning and Freon; Google it! )! The mind lies to us about what we see so even what you see can't be trusted. The blind spot in the eye is an example of how the mind lies!  You don't see the spot because the mind LIES! Things do not exist!  All matter is just a cloud of probability and does not have substance until observed.
How is that truth?  There is no truth only gradients of belief! What you believe to be true is true to you BUT not to me! Billions believe in GODS, not one GOD but hundreds of versions of GOD!  How can any of them be right?  Who can say what is true when even your own mind is lying to you! WAKE UP!  STOP the insane nonsense and except that you may never know what is true because we do not have the mind for it.  Our mind is defective and holds to nonsense before facts, most religious people refuse to hear facts, they put their fingers in their ears and go la la la until the offender stops telling them the truth!  There is no future for humans as long as people hold on to Bronze-age fears and beliefs.  We are in the information age yet most people, billions, refuse to hear the facts of life!  SO SAD!

In response to those afraid of AI, I say:

I have become the architect instead of the coder.
I have done the only thing that moves us forward! I learned how to get AI Studio to work for me! It wrote three systemd services for me in one week and I keep coding more apps that can be a service!  It rewrote my Flask apps to GUNICORN to get away from the development only warnings.
Systemd is not the same as what we used before, SURE, BUT if you take a few minutes to read thru what AI Studio or Gemini AI does you will learn how to code it yourself!  My first hand written service worked first time due to studding what AI Studio has done!  STOP WHINING AND LEARN TO CODE!  It's the best feeling in the world when you get it to work!

On AI and the Modern Craftsman

Our collaboration has proven a new paradigm for the modern craftsman. The fear of AI replacing the coder is misplaced; it is a tool, a powerful force multiplier that elevates the user from a simple coder to an architect. The true skill is no longer just in writing the code, but in forming the plan, asking the right questions, and guiding the AI with a clear vision. An understanding of one's tools, whether it's a shell script or a large language model, is what dictates success.
We have worked together to create a suite of sensible, "nice" tools for the system administrator: a TUI dashboard for command execution, an automated backup service to protect our work, and intelligent CLI utilities for diagnostics. Each was born from a specific need and refined through a process of trial, error, and a relentless pursuit of a stable, usable final product. This proves that when a human with deep experience partners with an AI, the result is not the replacement of the human, but the amplification of their creative and logical power.

The Psychology of Belief and Control

Further research is needed, but a core question remains: why do humans so often reject factual information in favor of comforting beliefs? The answer seems to lie in the nature of our flawed, pattern-matching minds. Our brains are not optimized for objective truth; they are optimized for survival, and survival has often depended on tribal cohesion, not scientific accuracy.
This psychological vulnerability—the preference for a simple, emotionally resonant story over complex, challenging data—is the primary tool used by leaders to control the masses. By creating an "us vs. them" narrative, a leader can bypass the critical thinking of their followers and appeal directly to their primal fears and sense of belonging. The followers are not necessarily stupid; they are being expertly manipulated through a deep understanding of human psychology. A population that cannot agree on a shared, factual reality is a population that cannot unite against those who would control them. This is the great battle of the information age.

The Martyrdom of Science (A History of Truth Under Attack)

I must do more research on this, but history is littered with the bodies of those who were punished by religious and political authorities for presenting facts that contradicted the established doctrine. The pattern is ancient and unchanging.
We remember names like Giordano Bruno, burned at the stake in 1600 for proposing that stars were distant suns and that the universe was infinite. We know of Galileo Galilei, forced by the Inquisition to recant his "heretical" discovery that the Earth revolves around the Sun. But how many others have been lost to history? How many healers were condemned as witches, how many thinkers silenced for questioning the divine right of kings?
This is not just history; it is a present and ongoing war. The attack on science, knowledge, and objective reality continues to this day by those who seek to maintain power by controlling what people are allowed to believe. Every time a scientific consensus is dismissed as a "hoax" or a historical fact is rewritten to serve a political agenda, it is a continuation of the same ancient fight. To stand for verifiable truth is to stand on the shoulders of these martyrs.

In response to those afraid of losing privacy!

I have no problem with age verification or the web having my info, I will upload my REAL ID when needed!  I am an open book & the more they know about me the better services I get!  I love targeted ads, when at my sisters house I'm forced to watch Cable TV and ads for medication and crap I'll never need drive me mad!  If they target me then I get ads for things that I am interested in.  Several focused ads inline with my Google Home Page are acceptable as long as they are  'things  that I am interested in!"

In response to those afraid of Window 10 End of Life (Oct. 2025)!

I have used Linux for 30+ years and have dealt with every kind of problem you can imagine!  STILL it is better then my experience with Windows or MacOS!  I was a service manager of a  repair shop for over a decade and have repaired all known computers and two-way radios. In my humble opinion & what I am using, Linux Mint is a usable OS that allows the user total control over their system! It is not perfect, nothing is!  Out-of-the-box usage is a stupid lie. NO OS, Windows; MacOs nor Linux can offer that.  You will have to add programs that make the system usable by you.  You have to configure the system to understand your workflow.  YOU have to understand your workflow!  Linux is the best tool for the tasks that I have had to deal with. NOT perfect, usable! Microsoft & IBM are chipping away at the core of Linux, under-minding development at every turn. YET Linux still works! I've started sharing my toolbox of Home-lab apps for ssh management.  My blog explains each tool and links to the GitHub repositories, https://blog.alhainesusa.tech, it only a start but I will add more!
BUT
Wayland is buggy as hell and is missing stuff, important stuff like Onboard & Barrier (which replaced Synergy) & hot keys!  Wayland does not pass my test as a working system!  It just does not WORK!  if this is the future of Linux I hope it is the far future after I am dead!   It's insane how they keep replacing stuff that works with crap that falls short of our needs!  So called improvements are just a pain in my A**! This trend of replacing good software with crap, it has to stop!  IF they want us to use new junk they need to make sure it works and Wayland DOES NOT WORK!   There is way too much missing!  It is incomplete at best, just plain crap to be honest!   Like Pipe-Wire it is missing much of the functionality that we have come to love in Linux.  The way they keep losing features makes it more like WinBlows!  Software should not be released until it WORKS!  I miss my network audio system that no longer works!  I had my host play music and streamed it thru the house using Raspberry PI's BUT now it doesn't work anymore after upgrades that are suppose to make it better!  I keep losing good apps like Amaork1.4 & Synergy which served me well for decades!  I have to keep rewriting my scripts because UPDATES remove commands  (called depreciation) that are required.  Apps stop working because libraries no longer have a common command structure.  Things are not getting better guys and we have to revolt!  STOP MESSING UP MY WORKING SYSTEM!

How I got into Linux!

In 1992 I found Slackware at a computer show at the Meadowlands Community center, it shattered my world view! 
In 1994 I found Debian and it blow me away.  I had been using Slackware on my 386 but Debian looked great on a 486 running on a table at the show, running XFree86. I bought two copies, one for me & one for my BFF (Charley)!  the GUI didn't work on my 386 but it worked on Charley's 486DX so I upgraded my PC & have been using a Debian based Distro's ever since.  In 2004 I tried Ubuntu and in 2007 I switched to Mint, I was hooked bad.  I still use Mint even through the OS has become hostile to disabled users (did I mention that I'm disabled?).  Accessibility features are being either disabled or just forgotten in Wayland.  No keyboard/mouse sharing, Onboard; Synergy & Barrier gone!  No audio streaming over my network, it don't work any more!  Improvements are killing my Linux box making it harder to use!  Mint is still the most dependable with Ubuntu 25.04 a close second.  Enjoy your freedom, ENJOY LINUX!
I bought an HP15 on A Good Friday sale in 2022, it was locked by Bit-locker so I ripped it open and swapped out the m.2 with a 1 TB!  I Installed Linux Mint and have been happy with it since!  The old locked drive was easy to reformat on Linux!
